## 💫 What is KULA?

**KULA** is not just another events app. It's a way to find **your people** through real-life meetings.

Tired of endless messaging in social media? Want **real connections**, but don't know where to start?

**KULA turns the desire to meet into reality.**

Think of it as **TikTok meets real-life events** — vertical video reels, but instead of dance videos, you're discovering actual meetups happening near you.

## 🎯 Who is this for?

### Love yoga?
Create a "Rooftop Yoga at Sunset" event — within 5 minutes you'll have 10 like-minded people ready to join.

### Want to play volleyball?
Post a quick video of the court, pick a time — team assembled.

### New to the city?
Find local gatherings: coffee with new people, board games, walks, concerts.

### Just bored tonight?
Scroll through the feed — maybe right now, somewhere nearby, interesting people are meeting up.

## ✨ Why KULA?

### 📹 **Video over text**
No long descriptions. A short vertical video immediately shows the vibe, place, and people. Scroll like TikTok, but instead of entertainment — real meetings.

### ⚡ **Fast and simple**
See an event → tap "Join" → show up. No registrations on 10 different sites, no endless chat coordination.

### 🎯 **Real meetings only**
No virtual "maybe someday." Every event has a **specific date, place, and time**. You're either going or not.

### 🌍 **Your city, your people**
Events near you. No need to travel across the city. Your Kula is those who live and hang out in your neighborhood.

### 💫 **No commitment**
No need to find "best friends forever." Just show up, try something new, meet people. Liked it — see you again. Didn't — thanks for the experience.

## 🔥 How it works

### 1. **Scroll the feed**
Open the app — see vertical videos of events. Swipe up — next event.

### 2. **Find your match**
Volleyball in the park? Coffee with a book? Night run? Choose what resonates.

### 3. **Tap "Join"**
That's it. You're in. Spot reserved, organizer knows you're coming.

### 4. **Show up and live**
No chats, no back-and-forth. Just show up at the right place and time.

## 🌟 What is "Kula"?

**Kula** (Sanskrit: कुल) means **community, family, circle of close people**.

In ancient India, Kula didn't just mean blood relatives, but people who **share your values, interests, and lifestyle**.

**Your Kula** isn't necessarily your childhood friends. It's people you **meet here and now**, and with whom **you feel good together**.

> *"There are 8 billion people in the world, but your Kula is just a few dozen. The key is finding them."*
